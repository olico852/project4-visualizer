# Wddit v2 Visualizer

For our final one week project I've built a simple data dashboard for my [Wdditv2](http://wdditv2.herokuapp.com/) project. After re-structuring then rigging Wdditv2 with the necessary cookies, this visualizer polls real-time data from the live site.

I learnt how to use D3.JS, a powerful JavaScript library to create graphs dynamically. The project also gave me an insight into how web dev, data management, data analytics and data visualization worked together.

## Acknowledgements

Many thanks to GA SG WDI 7 instructor Jeremiah and TA Nick for encouraging me to attempt a project that married both of my skill sets. It's a mammoth of a project for a one week sprint but the gains were worth it!
