# Wddit v2 Visualizer

For our final one week project I built a simple data dashboard for my [Wdditv2](http://wdditv2.herokuapp.com/) project. After re-structuring the platform then rigging Wdditv2 with the necessary cookies, the visualizer polls real-time data from the live site.

I learnt how to use D3.JS, a powerful JavaScript library to create graphs dynamically. The project also gave me an insight into how web dev, data management, data analytics and data visualization worked together.

Many thanks to GA SG WDI 7 instructor Jeremiah and TA Nick for encouraging me to attempt a project that married both of my skill sets. It's a mammoth of a project for a one week sprint but the gains were worth it!
